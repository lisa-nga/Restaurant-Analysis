## Introduction
This is a Power Bi project on the consumer analysis and ratings of some Mexican restaurants by real consumers from 2012. It includes additional information about each restaurant and their cuisines, and each consumer and their preferences.

## Problem Statement
1. What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on ratings?
The top overall rated restaurants had their prices falling in the medium price category.
3. What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
4. Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
5. If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?


the following potential demand and supply gaps:

Quality: If there are a lot of Mexican restaurants in the area but few have high ratings, there may be a demand for restaurants that focus on quality and authentic Mexican cuisine.
Price: If the restaurants with the highest ratings are also the most expensive, there may be a gap in the market for more affordable Mexican restaurants that still offer good quality food.
Cuisine: If there are few restaurants in the area that specialize in a particular type of Mexican cuisine (e.g. street food, regional specialties), there may be a demand for restaurants that focus on these types of dishes.
